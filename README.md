Roundcube Search Scope plugin
=============================

This plugin lets you define the default search scope in the searchbox.

Installation
============

Clone the repository and name the directory `search_scope`:

```sh
cd $ROUNDCUBE_HOME/plugins
git clone https://github.com/daniele-athome/roundcube-search-scope.git search_scope
```

Copy the file `config.php.dist` to `config.php` and modify it to your needs (there is really one parameter).

After that, add the plugin to your configuration by using `search_scope`.
